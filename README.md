# Youth Services Bureau of Ottawa (Client project)

This was a part of a project that I did for a non-profit organization in Ottawa that provides services to assist youth in troubled times.
In my particular analysis, I was responsible for analyzing engagement trends across time in their major programs ranging from housing, mental health, community, and housing services.
This involved looking at trends in the number of people who utilized these services along with the number of days they were in each program category.
Heat maps and streamgraph visualizations were created, but none of the visualizations nor precise numbers are shown due to confidentiality constraints.

This analysis is located in ysb_trend_analysis.RMD.



I also developed 2 R Shiny apps (bubble plots) that allows the user to interactively filter by year and program category as an additional tool to show membership and engagement trends across different program categories to their clients.

The R shiny app code used to generate the visualizations are located in ysb_count.R and ysb_avg_time.R.
This code can also be used as a template to create interactive ggplot2 visualizations within an R Shiny app, and can be applied to any data set simply by modifying the variable names and the imported data sets.
