# Data-exploration-and-visualization
This repo serves as storage for my data exploration and visualization projects.

This repo contains projects related to the code and analysis behind a few data science and visualization projects that I have worked on either as a student, for fun or as a volunteer for
non-profit organizations.

The purpose of this repo is to showcase projects that are specific to the visualization and analysis of data relating to some of the data sets that I have worked with in the past.
There are comprehensive exploratory data analyses (EDA), specific projects done for clients, along with code structures behind some of the visualizations that I produced.
For confidentiality reasons, the actual data and visualizations may not be shown.

Coding languages used in this repo may include Python, R, d3.js.
