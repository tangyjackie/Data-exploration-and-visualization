# Yelp Exploratory Data Analysis (Businesses data set)

This exploratory data analysis (EDA) is based on Yelp's famous Businesses open data set provided to us by Yelp at https://www.yelp.com/dataset.

Because this data set is rather large, the concentration of the analysis in this particular EDA has mainly been based on rating trends and preferences across restaurants in the 9 largest cities
covered in the data set. The data set is only a sample of Yelp's vast treasure trove of data, but it does give some detailed insights into
the perceptions behind most business establishments.

Please see yelp_eda_project1.md for the complete analysis.
